## Fuzzy Responsive Images

This repository contains tests comparing images exported directly from **CoreMedia Studio** using different compression levels and dimensions.  
It also includes a local setup **CoreMedia CAE preview**.

---

### Objective

Evaluate the **impact of compression, resizing, and scaling** on both **visual quality** and **file size**, in order to determine the optimal balance between quality and performance across multiple formats and resolutions (e.g., 1:1, 4:3, 8:3).

#### ðŸ§© HTML-Based Comparison

The main test page (`index.html`) includes 4 Ratios with:
- **2 HQ images** â€” one at normal resolution and one delivered at **2Ã— size**.  
- **2 Fuzzy images** â€” one at normal resolution and one delivered at **2Ã— size**.  
- These combinations are used to evaluate **downscaling effects**.

**CoreMedia Studio**:
- Repository with frontend files
- https://github.com/jcostacoremedia/responsive_images/edit/main/README.md

Two teasers were created â€” each configured with a specific test image (HQ or Fuzzy).

- ![Teaser](screenshots/teaser-fuzzy.png)

These teasers were added to a **custom test page** for live comparison.
- ![Page](screenshots/page-with-layout.png)

A **layout variant** was created to provide a tailored visual structure inside the CAE preview environment.

The layout is **accessible through the local CoreMedia test environment**, allowing responsive and rendering tests directly in preview.
